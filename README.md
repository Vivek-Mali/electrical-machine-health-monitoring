# Description 
This project presents a comprehensive system for monitoring the health of three-phase induction motors using fuzzy logic and real-time sensor data. It leverages ESP32, PZEM modules, and sensors to continuously track voltage, current, temperature, and vibration. The system intelligently classifies the motorâ€™s condition into Normal, Warning, or Critical using fuzzy logic algorithms.

# Key features include

-Sensor Integration: Real-time voltage, current, power, temperature, and vibration monitoring

-IoT Dashboard: MQTT-based data transmission for remote visualization

-GSM Alerts: SMS notifications on critical motor faults

-Local Display: LCD for on-site monitoring

-Fuzzy Logic: Smart fault classification that handles sensor uncertainty

-Predictive Maintenance: Reduces downtime and improves operational reliability

This system is ideal for industrial automation, predictive maintenance, and smart motor control.

1. WiFi Connection Setup 

Input: 

â€¢ SSID (WiFi name) 

â€¢ Password (WiFi password) 

Output: 

â€¢ ESP32 connected to the WiFi network 

â€¢ Connection status displayed on the LCD and serial monitor 

Steps: 

-Initialize the serial communication (Serial.begin) for debugging.

-Initialize the LCD screen and display a message ("Connecting to WiFi..."). 

-Call WiFi.begin(ssid, password) to start the WiFi connection. 

-Check WiFi.status() in a loop: 

-If not connected, print a message ("Connecting...") to the serial monitor and wait 1 second.

-Once connected, print "WiFi Connected" to the serial monitor.

-Display "WiFi Connected" on the LCD. 

3. MQTT Setup and Reconnection 

Input: 

â€¢ MQTT server address 

â€¢ MQTT port 

Output: 

â€¢ Active MQTT connection 

â€¢ Data sent to the MQTT broker 

Steps: 

-Initialize the PubSubClient with the MQTT server and port.

-In the main loop, check client.connected(): 

o If the client is disconnected: 

â–ª Attempt to reconnect using client.connect("Client_ID"). 

â–ª Print success or failure messages to the serial monitor. 

â–ª Wait 2 seconds before retrying if the connection fails. 

-Once connected, call client.loop() to maintain the connection. 

3. Fuzzy Logic Setup 

Input: 

â€¢ Voltage and current readings from sensors 

â€¢ Fuzzy rules for fault evaluation 

Output: 

â€¢ Fuzzy fault level: "Normal," "Warning," or "Critical" 

Steps: 

-Define fuzzy input variables: 

o Voltage: Define sets for "Low Voltage," "Normal Voltage," and "High Voltage." 

o Current: Define sets for "Low Current," "Normal Current," and "High Current." 

Define fuzzy output variables: 

o Fault Level: Define sets for "Normal," "Warning," and "Critical." 

Create fuzzy rules: 

o Rule 1: If Voltage is Low and Current is Low, Fault Level is Normal. 

o Rule 2: If Voltage is Normal and Current is Normal, Fault Level is Warning. 

o Rule 3: If Voltage is High or Current is High, Fault Level is Critical. 

Initialize the fuzzy system with these inputs, outputs, and rules.

4. Sensor Data Acquisition (PZEM Sensors) 

Input: 

â€¢ RX and TX pins for each PZEM sensor 

Output: 

â€¢ Voltage, Current, and Power readings for each phase 

Steps: 

-Initialize three PZEM sensor objects, each representing a phase. 

-Read sensor data using: 

o pzem.voltage() for voltage. 

o pzem.current() for current. 

o pzem.power() for power. 

-Check for invalid data (e.g., -1 returned by the library) and handle errors appropriately. 

-Store the readings for further processing.

5. Fuzzy Logic Evaluation 

Input: 

â€¢ Voltage and current readings for each phase 

â€¢ Predefined fuzzy rules 

Output: 

â€¢ Fault Level (Numerical and Categorized as "Normal," "Warning," or "Critical") 

Steps: 

-Pass the voltage and current readings for a phase to the fuzzy system using setInput().

-Run the fuzzification process to evaluate the inputs based on defined fuzzy sets. 

-Apply the fuzzy rules to derive a fault level. 

-Defuzzify the output to compute a numerical fault level. 

-Categorize the fault level: 

o <50: Normal 

o 50-80: Warning 

o 80: Critical

6. Display Fault Level on LCD 

Input: 

â€¢ Fault Level 

â€¢ Sensor readings (Voltage, Current, Power) 

Output: 

â€¢ Real-time fault status displayed on the LCD 

Steps: 

-Clear the LCD display.

-Set the cursor to the desired position.

-Display the fault level (Normal, Warning, or Critical) on the first line. 

-Optionally, display voltage, current, and power values for each phase on subsequent lines. 

7. Publish Data to MQTT 

Input: 

â€¢ Sensor readings for each phase 

â€¢ Fault Level 

Output: 

â€¢ JSON payload sent to the MQTT broker 

Steps: 

-Format the sensor data and fault level into a JSON string.

-Use client.publish(topic, payload) to send the data to the MQTT broker. 

-Print success or failure messages to the serial monitor. 

-Retry publishing if the transmission fails.
