# Extended Description 
This project presents a comprehensive system for monitoring the health of three-phase induction motors using fuzzy logic and real-time sensor data. It leverages ESP32, PZEM modules, and sensors to continuously track voltage, current, temperature, and vibration. The system intelligently classifies the motor’s condition into Normal, Warning, or Critical using fuzzy logic algorithms.

# Key features include:

-Sensor Integration: Real-time voltage, current, power, temperature, and vibration monitoring

-IoT Dashboard: MQTT-based data transmission for remote visualization

-GSM Alerts: SMS notifications on critical motor faults

-Local Display: LCD for on-site monitoring

-Fuzzy Logic: Smart fault classification that handles sensor uncertainty

-Predictive Maintenance: Reduces downtime and improves operational reliability

This system is ideal for industrial automation, predictive maintenance, and smart motor control.
