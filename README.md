# Extended Description 
This project presents a comprehensive system for monitoring the health of three-phase induction motors using fuzzy logic and real-time sensor data. It leverages ESP32, PZEM modules, and sensors to continuously track voltage, current, temperature, and vibration. The system intelligently classifies the motorâ€™s condition into Normal, Warning, or Critical using fuzzy logic algorithms.

# Key features include

-Sensor Integration: Real-time voltage, current, power, temperature, and vibration monitoring

-IoT Dashboard: MQTT-based data transmission for remote visualization

-GSM Alerts: SMS notifications on critical motor faults

-Local Display: LCD for on-site monitoring

-Fuzzy Logic: Smart fault classification that handles sensor uncertainty

-Predictive Maintenance: Reduces downtime and improves operational reliability

This system is ideal for industrial automation, predictive maintenance, and smart motor control.
